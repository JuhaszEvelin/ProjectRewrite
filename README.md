# ProjectRewrite
During my education I found the following rewrite projects very useful.  
After these projects I could deeply understand the function of these Java elements.

I left every project as I wrote first, so you can see my own development. 
You cannot see now but originally these projects was written with atomic commits to github and the end of this course we also used several branches to merge into development branch.

In packages you can find short descriptions about these tasks.
