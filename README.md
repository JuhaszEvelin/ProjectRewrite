# ProjectRewrite
During my education I found the following rewrite projects very useful.  
After these projects I have deeper understand the operations of Java.

I left every project as I wrote first, so you can see my own development. 
You cannot see now but originally these projects was written with atomic commits to github and the end of this course we also used several branches to merge into development branch.

In these packages you can find short descriptions about these projects and my impressions.

Please note that this project is under progress - I am planning to extend my knowledge with rewrite tasks which will be implemented here.
