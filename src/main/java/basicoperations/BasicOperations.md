# Week 2 - Project rewrite - basic operations without OOP

My task was to reimplement some basic built-in functionalities of a language or its standard library
for pedagogical reasons without using built-in functionalities or the standard library itself.

There was other restrictions like do not use the * and / operators in multiply method 
and do not use the / and the % operator in divmod method.
and do not use * operator in pow method.

Advanced optional tasks was to implement min method in one line and multiply method without any loop.

Caveat: I donâ€™t use such code in my commercial projects!

It was a challenge to get a code skeleton like this and wrote such methods right after my first "Hello World" script.
Lots of semantical and syntactical faults came up, it was a chaos in my mind firstly and after this project it has become clear.
