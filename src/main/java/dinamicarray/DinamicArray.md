# Week 7 - Project rewrite - Arraylist<>

My task was to reimplement some basic built-in features of a language or its standard library for pedagogical reasons without using the feature itself or similar features. 

Caveat: I donâ€™t use such code in my commercial projects!

In this project the prewritten DynamicArrayTest was very helpful, but it was one of the first time we used tests, so I was not familiar with it. 
That is why I created an extra Main class to check the results and debug.
