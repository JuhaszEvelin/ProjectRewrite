# Week 16 - Project rewrite - HashTable<> /OPTIONAL PROJECT/

My task was to reimplement some basic built-in features of a language or its standard library for pedagogical reasons without using the feature itself or similar features. 

Caveat: I donâ€™t use such code in my commercial projects!

This is an optional project from the last week, it is in progress - this is the starter project you can check how a starter project looked like.
