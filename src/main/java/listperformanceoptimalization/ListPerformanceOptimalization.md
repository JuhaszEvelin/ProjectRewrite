# Week 11 - Project rewrite - LinkedList<> VS ArrayList<>

At this project we got prewritten classes with the same code implementations for ArraylistHistory and LinkedListHistory which failed in performance tests.
Our task was to refactor these classes to get the best performance results as can. 

With this project I could learn the different charachteristics of the two List type and practiced streams. 

I enjoyed this project because I needed to try several ideas and I had a lot of experience of success because I got solutions quickly and they worked really great.
You can see tests results before and after rewrite (check it in src/listperformanceoptimalization).
