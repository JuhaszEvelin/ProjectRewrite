Week 8 - Project rewrite - LinkedList<>

My task was to reimplement some basic built-in features of a language or its standard library for pedagogical reasons without using the feature itself or similar features. 

Caveat: I donâ€™t use such code in my commercial projects!

It was the first time we should write all the method to run tests - it made me some headache to debug tests why is it fault before I realized that test cases use almost every method which should be implemented to run correctly test class.
In my first commit you can see my original commits - it is in hunagarian because it is only for myself. I use english commits and docs for group projects.
