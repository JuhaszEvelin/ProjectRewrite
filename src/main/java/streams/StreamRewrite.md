# Week 10 - Project rewrite - Streams - /PET PROJECT/

One of our mentoring lessons was about streams. 
Our task was to rewrite foreach and filter method of java.util.stream and practiced lambda expressions, method reference, anonymus inner classes.
You can see my own solutions.

I left my notes in the code, so you can see how I process new informations.
These notes written for deeper understand - in real project I always clear this notes before push to git and leave only necessary notes for the others and future myself.
