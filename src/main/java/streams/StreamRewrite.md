# Week 10 - Project rewrite - Streams - /PET PROJECT/

One of our mentoring lessons was about streams. 
Our optional task was to rewrite foreach and filter method of java.util.stream and practice lambda expressions, method reference, anonymus inner classes.
You can see my own solutions here.

I left my notes in the code, so you can see how I process new informations.
Please note that these notes was written for deeper understand only - in real project I always clear my notes for understand before push to git and leave only necessary notes for the others and future myself.
